Why did I learn to code? It seems to be a question I've been getting a lot lately. Sometimes from friends or family, other times during casual conversations with strangers. I truth is, it's actually a rather drawn-out story and maybe a bit irregular. I didn't start coding out of passion or intrigue. I started to code out of necessity. 

Back in 2011, I was working as a stylist for a national fashion retailer. My job was to produce photo shoots for the retailers e-commerce. Booking photographers, wrangling models, pushing giant racks of clothing around, etc. For the majority of my week, I never touched a computer. 

Now in an e-commerce business (or at least the one I was working in), if the products were not selling, there could only be two reasons. Either the buyer bought something the customers didn't want or the photos were shit. Unfortunately, since the buyers were part of senior management, the fault usually fell on me. 

After an extended period of downward pressure, I began to search for other reasons why our sales were slowing. And sure, maybe the photos did suck, but in an effort to relieve some pressure on me, I brought up that our website could use some work. What's the point of nice photos if the customers have to view them at a poor resolution, muddled together with what I would not call a very sad interface. 

The company didn't have any technical staff aside from the guy who fixed our router and didn't have the budget to hire a developer, so my team and I were left to our own devices. We directly edited the live CSS via FTP in a process that went something like this:

1. Seach the stylesheet for an ID that sounded English enough to guess what it was.
2. Guess what types of values the existing selectors would accept.
3. Edit & Save the file.
4. Refresh the browser.
5. Cmd-Z & Save as fast as possible!
6. Repeat till something good happened. 

Fast forward a couple years and a lot of learning, I founded (*then sold*) a digitally focused design agency. Luckily, we hired experienced developers and have learned some safer workflows since when I would first editing CSS commando. However, many of our first clients were ex-colleagues from back in the day who gave me a call and said: "Hey, you know how to code, right?".
